# StopPredictionWebpage

Web page for displaying stop predictions for our most used transit stops.

## Getting Started

This will help you with getting started with the project.

### Prerequisites

Ideally, you'll want a web server that can serve all the files included, but
it should work fine from `file://`.

You will also want to get your own WMATA API key and put that in `index.html`.
The included key is the Demo WMATA API key.

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/bradlech/StopPredictionWebpage
````

## Deployment

Set your web server to serve `index.html` by default and make the `*.js` files as
well (which most should do by default). Put your API key in `index.html`.
